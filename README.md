# covid-19

Because of new features added to website, this script is semi fucked.

You can still use ./covid.py country {infected/dead} but the ncurses does NOT work as intended


A quick and dirty python script to get information for specific countries regarding the current covid virus.

Using requests, urwid and BeautifulSoup

pip install requests

pip install urwid

pip install beautifulsoup4

Run using "python covid.py" or chmod +x and run "./covid.py"

Alternatively use ./covid.py country {infected/dead} to get information printed to stdout
